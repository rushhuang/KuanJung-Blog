畢業於國立清華大學資訊系統與應用研究所。大學主修生物，但在求學過程中發現自己對於寫程式的興趣，進而選擇攻讀電腦科學相關研究所。目前對於電腦視覺及影像處理相關領域有興趣。

I was graduated from the Institute of Information Systems and Applications of National Tsing Hua University. Despite majoring in Biology during my college life, I found myself increasingly interested in programming and decided to pursue a master degree in the field of Computer Science. I am currently interested in the field of computer vision and image processing.
